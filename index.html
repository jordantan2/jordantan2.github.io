              northern suburbs of Perth and is in her second year of studies in

              programming through her skill and enjoyment in mathematics growing
              up. She has worked in hospitality since the young age of 15, being
              a quick learner she was able to gain many great skills in the

              detail allowed her to work in high class restaurants and be
              promoted to supervisory roles. She hopes to carry her learnings
              with her into her next journey, working in her desired field. Her
